# about
My name is Atsuko Ito, aka `yottatsa`, <abbr>Akko</abbr>rori~n, 伊藤惇子.

If you want to contact me, drop me a line to me at yottatsa dot name, or find me on [tilde.chat] IRC.

I've always been inspired with the thing that I recently learnt the name of, [permacomputing]. This goes to the all things I've been working on recently, like

* preservation and integration of old tech,
* restoration of lost skills: [PCMCIA Cards][cardbarker], [mechanical typewriters][Olympia],
* designing (or rather [fantasizng on][uxn-unx]) low-power or Unix-like compact systems.

This place is made with [low-effort tools][meta] and designed to contain the thoughts and the artifacts during <a rel="me" href="https://deadinsi.de/@yottatsa">my journey</a>.

Best wishes,
A.I.
