# about
My name is Atsuko Ito, aka `yottatsa`, Akko[rori~n], 伊藤惇子.

I read mail at me [at] yottatsa.name, and you can [find me on keybase](https://keybase.io/yottatsa).

I've always been inspired with the thing that I recently learnt the name of, [permacomputing]. This goes to the all things I've been working on recently, like

* preservation and integration of old tech,
* restoration of lost skills: [PCMCIA Cards][cardbarker], [mechanical typewriters][Olympia],
* designing (or rather [fantasizng on][uxn-unx]) low-power or Unix-like compact systems.

This place is made with [low-effort tools][meta] and designed to contain the thoughts and the artifacts during <a rel="me" href="https://deadinsi.de/@yottatsa">my journey</a>.

Best wishes,
A.I.
