Turns out, it's amazing tool, not only because of it's look-n-feel, but also because one can't erase what's written, which helps against perfectionism.</p><p>She's been looking for classic, mechanical, and high-performance one, and both she and I eventually managed to buy two of them for about 100 GBP each.</p><p>First one was in a vary good mechanical condition, seemed to be used a lot and serviced. Hovewer, all the shiny chromium parts were in a bad shape. And it has two major issues: escapement wheel has been damaged, and the rubber platen dried and hardened.</p><p>I was very lucky that I was able to obtain exactly the same model. It was hardly used, but also never maintained, and stored badly. So it has a nice soft resin on it's platen, and the mechanism was intact, despite not being oiled for ages. </p><p>See [Infinite Paper Machine][infinite-paper-machine] interface.</p></main></body></html>
