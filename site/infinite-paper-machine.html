<h1>Infinite Paper Machine</h1>
<p>Computer interface for a typewriter. Inspired by 
* TTY interfaces for their line-by-line UX;
* OberonOS, C64 BASIC for type anywhere command interfaces; and
* <a href="https://www.nealstephenson.com/the-diamond-age.html">The Diamond Age</a> for pen and paper messaging interface.</p>

<p>Imagine a TTY interface that allows you to scroll the paper output both forwards and backwards with a line feed knob or lever. Opening an email, or manpage, or an article won't create massive scroll action, and text could be read in a comfortable pace.</p>

<p>Current output creates context, which could be used for subsequent actions. Forwarding an article, or trying out a command in repl terminal. Those actions might start right in the middle of the current output, at the caret position, and without modifying the exisiting content. Occasionally, paper margins could be used to enrich the output.</p>
