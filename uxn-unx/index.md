The [varvara]/[uxn] concept looks beautiful as it is. Especially with [paradise], it asks not to bring there any of the conceptions one learned before.

As a unix-like systems engineer, I really miss fork/wait/kill in varvara, this way I could build something unix-like out of it.
Tho I'm still worried I just do things the way I learnt things should be. This approach works well in commercial world, sure. Would it work in the *world of art*?
