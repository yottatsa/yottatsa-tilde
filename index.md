# just a space for notes

I've always been inspired with the thing that I recently learnt the name of, [permacomputing]. This goes to the all things I've been working on recently, like

* preservation and integration of old tech,
* restoration of lost skills: [PCMCIA Cards][cardbarker], [mechanical typewriters][Olympia],
* designing (or rather [fantasizng on][uxn-unx]) low-power or Unix-like compact systems.

This place is designed to contain the thoughts and the artifacts during my <a rel="me" href="https://deadinsi.de/@yottatsa">journey</a>.
